## GreatGrandNancy

### What's about ?

* This project is the result of the Hackathon "ul.codeln24"
* The goal was to make an app which could help a family, a student or a professional
to choose in which city they will wants move in, according
their profile, the activities and interest points
* This must use Open Data from INSEE and GrandNancy

### How does it was done ?

* We parsed INSEE and GrandNancy data to put the in mysql database
* We built a REST API which gives the result in JSON format with Slim3 framework
* We developed an simple interactive interface, in AngularJS,
which combine informations from our API and Google Places API. 

### Any exemple of use ?

* A typical student, he wants to know where to move in according the location
 of his school, the distance between a market and his flat...
